# Image processing using opencv and python 
## What:
#### Image processing:
Image processing is basically to take an image as an input and produce an output image with some modification and information extraction. here in the below codes, I have used opencv and python2 for a number of applications

#### What you need before this :
##### Python:
Python is one of the most simple yet elegant programming languages. It is super easy to learn and has a hell load of applications. Since the codes are in python, it is logical to expect enough profeciency in python. Following are some of the concepts needed 
..* basic keywords and flow controls
..* creating functions in python
..* working with classes in python
..* working with numpy arrays
..* data structures in python
..* working with modules


If on a linux system, it is most probable that you already have a version of python2 and 3 already installed. If not, execute following commands from your terminal to install python:

```$sudo apt-get install python```


```$sudo apt-get install python3```

To enter the python shell fronm terminal, simply run

```$python```

or

```$python3```

we also need numpy, to install numpy, run


```$sudo apt-get install python-numpy```


##### Opencv:

To run the above codes it is important that we have the latest version of opencv installed on the system.

The easy way to do so is:

```$sudo apt-get install python-opencv```

it installs opencv and basic libraries needed to run the above codes

The proper way takes more time and commands to install, hence reffer to the following [link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
